    <string name="lorem_ipsum">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</string>

    <string name="about_app">Application is the result of work with drones. App supports veriety of devices from 4.0 to 7.0.0 with the newest SDK and libraries. We want to move some features from Mission Planner and connect in simple mobile app. DronE should also be the business card of the Drone Team Project with the most important informations. App uses many dependencies that we are very thankful: \n#rey5137:material \n#smart-fun:SmartFonts \n#ms-square:expandableTextView \n#picasso:picasso \n#coyarzun89:fabtransitionactivity \n#rengwuxian.materialedittext \n#jakewharton:butterknife </string>
    <string name="about_me">I am android software developer really interested in new mobile technologies. I love working with code and devices at the same time.
